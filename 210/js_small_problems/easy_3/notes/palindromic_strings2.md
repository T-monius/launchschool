## Palindromic Strings Part 2

### Task
- Write another function that returns `true` if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

If you wish, you may simplify things by calling the `isPalindrome` function you wrote in the previous exercise.

### Implementation
- Strip the input string with a RegEx and call the `isPalindrome` function
