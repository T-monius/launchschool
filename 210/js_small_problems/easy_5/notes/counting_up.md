## Counting Up

### Understanding
- Write a function
- Input
  + integer
  + All examples are positive
- Output
  + An array of sequential integers from 1 to the input number

### Task
- Write a function that takes an integer argument, and returns an array containing all integers between `1` and the argument (inclusive), in ascending order.

- You may assume that the argument will always be a positive integer.

### Implementation
- Set an array for return
- Iterate from 1
  + Push indexes at iteration to the array
  + while the index is less than or equal to the input number
- Return the array
