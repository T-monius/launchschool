## Double Char Part 2

### Understanding
- Double only consonants

### Task
- Write a function that takes a string, doubles every consonant character in the string, and returns the result as a new string. The function should not double vowels ('a','e','i','o','u'), digits, punctuation, or whitespace.

### Implementation
- Use the previous function
- Build a regex with all consonants to use as a conditional inside the function for doubling
