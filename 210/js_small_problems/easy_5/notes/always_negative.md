## Always Return Negative

### Understanding
- The negative sign indicates negative
- When working with numbers, it's whether a number is less than `0`
  + The example seems to indicate that even `0` is negative

### Task
- Write a function that takes a number as an argument. If the argument is a positive number, return the negative of that number. If the argument is a negative number, return it as-is.

### Implementation
- Test for whether a number is greater than or equal to `0`
   * Return it negated if so
   * Else, return the number as is
