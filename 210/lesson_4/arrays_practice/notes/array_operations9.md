## `concat` Method

### Understanding
- Input
  + 2 arguments
  + Arrays
  + Combine the arrays
- Output
  + New array

### Task
- Write a function named `concat` that accepts two Array arguments. The function should return a new Array that contains the values from each of the original Arrays.

- *You may use functions that were answers to previous practice problems to complete this problem, but do not use any built-in Array methods.*

### Implementation
- Set a variable to an empty array
- Iterate the first array
  + Push all elements to the new array
- Iterate the second array
  + Push all elements to the new array
