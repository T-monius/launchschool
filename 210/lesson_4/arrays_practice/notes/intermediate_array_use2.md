## Intermediate Array Uses

### Understanding
- Input
  + 2 arrays
- Output
  + A single new array
  + Alternating index elements from the input arrays

### Task
- Write a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array whose even positions come from the first array, and whose odd positions come from the second array. Assume that both arrays have equal length.

### Implementation
- Set a return array
- Iterate
  + Push the elements of the seconday input then the primary input at each iteration
- Return
