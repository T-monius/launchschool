## Problem 3

### Understanding
- Create a new array
- Reveresed contents
  + Do this manually

### Task
- Create a function that returns the contents of the array it receives as an argument, but with the values in reversed order. Your function should use a for loop that iterates over the elements in the array from the end of the array to the beginning, and pushes each element's value to a new result array. Be sure to start your loop with the element whose index is one less than the input array's length.

### Implementation
- Set a new array variable
- iterat over the input array
  + Reverse order
  + Push contents to a new array
