## String Starts With

### Understanding
- Input
  + A string
  + A substring
- Output
  + Boolean
  + Whether first input starts with the second

### Task
- Implement a function that determines whether a string begins with another string. If it does, the function should return `true`, or `false` otherwise.
- You may use the square brackets (`[]`) to access a character by index (as shown below), and the length property to find the string length. However, you may not use any other properties or methods from JavaScript's built-in String class.

### Implementation
- Determine the length of the secondary input
  + Compare the secondary input
  + Same length of secondary input compared to that portion of the first
