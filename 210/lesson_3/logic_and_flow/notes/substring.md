## Substring(1)

### Understanding
- 
  + If negative length of the string minus the character
  + `start`
    * Difference between `start` and `endpoint` is length of iteration

### Task
- Write a function that returns a substring of a string based on a starting index and length.

### Implementation
- Set the starting index
- Set the ending index
- Iterate from the starting index
  + Push characters
  + Stop iteration at the last index
- Return substring
