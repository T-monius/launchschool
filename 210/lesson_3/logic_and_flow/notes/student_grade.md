## Student Grade

### Understanding
- 

### Task
- Write a program to determine a studentâ€™s grade based on the average of three scores you get from the user. Use these rules to compute the grade:

- If the average score is greater than or equal to 90 then the grade is 'A'
- If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 90 then the grade is 'B'
- If the average score is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 70 then the grade is 'C'
- If the average score is less than 50 then the grade is 'F'
- You may assume that all input values are valid positive integers.

### Implementation
- 

### Further Exploration
- Our solution limits us to exactly three input scores. Modify it to accept any number of scores. To simplify matters, move the computation of the average into a function.

#### Understanding
- My solution already took into consideration taking in an arbitrary number of scores
- It also took out the redundance of the message prompts.
