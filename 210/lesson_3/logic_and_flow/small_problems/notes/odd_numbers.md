## Odd Numbers

### Understanding
- Log
  + `console.log` will log and follow with a newline
- Check oddity with remainder of 1 when dividing by 2

### Task
- Log all odd numbers from `1` to `99`, inclusive, to the console. Log all numbers on separate lines.

### Implementation
- Iterate from 1 to 99
  + If number is odd, log it

#### Further Exploration
- Repeat this exercise with a technique different from the one that you used, and different from the one provided. Also consider adding a way for the user to specify the limits of the odd numbers logged to the console.

##### Understanding
- Write a function with an argument to indicate the breakpoint
