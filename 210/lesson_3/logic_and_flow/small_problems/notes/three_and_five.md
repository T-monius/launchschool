## Multiples of 3 and 5

### Understanding
- Write a function
- Compute the sum of some numbers
- Numbers from 1 to a limit
- Compute as part of the sum numbers that are multiples of 3 or five

### Task
- Write a function that computes the sum of all numbers between `1` and some other number, inclusive, that are multiples of `3` or `5`. For instance, if the supplied number is `20`, the result should be `98` (`3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20`).

You may assume that the number passed in is an integer greater than 1.

### Implementation
- Set a total variable
- Iterate from 1
- Add a number to the running total if it is a multiple of 3 or 5
