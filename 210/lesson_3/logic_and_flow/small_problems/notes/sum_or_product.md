## Sum or Product of Consecutive Integers

### Understanding
- Input is a string
- All numbers calculated are integers
- Running total/memo

### Task
- Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than `0`, then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or the product of all numbers between `1` and the entered integer, inclusive.

### Implementation
- Prompt for integer
- Prompt for operation
  + Set both prompt return values to variables
- Set a variable for the total
- Iterate from 1
  + At each iteration perform the operation
- Output the total in a string
  + Indicate the type of operation
