## Right Triangles

### Understanding
- Write a function
- Logging to the console
  + Spaces
    * Number of spaces is equal to the max number of stars/ limit minus the line number
  + Asterisks
    * Number of asterisks is equal to the line number

### Task
- Write a function that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and logs a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

### Implementation
- Set a variable for spaces
- Set a variable for asterisks
- Set a variable for iteration
- Iterate
  + Increment my iteration variable by one
  + Numebr of stars equals iterator
  + Number of spaces max stars minus iterator
  + Print spaces and stars
    * As a single string
