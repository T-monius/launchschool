## JS210: Computational Thinking and JavaScript Programming

## Summary
- 2 Creative Steps for programming
1. Understand the problem; build a virtual model to solve it abstractly
2. Implement model; formal programming language
- Course Goal
  + Help beginners think logically and computationally
    * Set of problem solving patterns
  + Learn JS
    * Subset of language
    * 'OO' + 'Front-end' portions later
  + Computational thinking:
    * Logical thinking; problem analysis
    * Procedural thinking: the bottom up, imperative expressions
    * Common problem solving patterns
  + JS
    * Grammar, syntax, data types
    * Functions and higher order functions
    * Arrays and Objects as data structures
    * Core built-in methods
    * Writing idiomatic and stylistic code

- JavaScript Versions
  + AKA ACMAScript
    * ECMAScript2015 / ECMAScript version 6 / ES6 is current
  + Our focus is ECMAScript 5
    * Most programs are currently written in this version
