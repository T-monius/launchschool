## Math abs

### Understanding
- Variable with `-180` value
- Function
  + Input
    * Takes the variable as an argument?
    * Presumable, could have side effects on the outer variable
  + Output
    * Log the absolute value of the negative number

### Task
- To convert a positive integer to a negative integer, you can just place a minus sign in front of the variable that contains the integer. However, if you don't know whether the original value is negative you may inadvertently convert your variable to the wrong value. You can use the `Math.abs` method to simplify matters by forcing a value positive. For this problem, create a variable with a value of `-180`, then use `Math.abs` to log the positive value of the variable.
