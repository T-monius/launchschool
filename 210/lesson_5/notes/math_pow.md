## Math POW

### Understanding
- No need to create function
- `Math.pow`
  + 2 arguments
    * Base
      - The number to take to a given power
    * Exponent
      - Decimal exponents return roots
      - `0.5` square root
  - Output
    * The result of taking the base to the power of the exponent

### Task
- Suppose, instead, that we want to calculate the 6th power of a number. We could multiply a number by itself six times with a function. However, it is easier to just use `Math.pow`. `Math.pow` takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the result. Use `Math.pow` to compute and log the value of 16 to the 6th power.

### Implementation
- Log the return value of `Math.pow` with a it's arguments
