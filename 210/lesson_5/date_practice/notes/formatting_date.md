## Fully Formatted Date

### Understanding
- `formattedMonth`
  + Input
    * Needs the array of months
    * Needs the month variable (an integer)
- `formattedDay`
  + Input
    * Integer
    * Needs the array of days of the week
- `formattedDate`
  + Input
    * Needs the date object
    * Extracts some variables to call other methods
    * Needs the `dateSuffix()` function
    * Calls the previous two functions
### Task
- Our call to `console.log` is getting cluttered. Let's clean things up a bit and refactor the code into a few formatting functions that we can call from anywhere in our code. Create `formattedMonth` and `formattedDay` functions to format the month and day, then write a `formattedDate` function that pulls everything together and logs the fully formatted date.

### Implementation
