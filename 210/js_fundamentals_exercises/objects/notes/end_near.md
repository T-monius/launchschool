## The End is Near But Not Here

### Understanding
- The array of words in the string cannot be accessed with the negative integer `-2`

### Task
- The `penultimate` function takes a string as an argument and returns the next-to-last word in the string. The function assumes that "words" are any sequence of non-whitespace characters. The function also assumes that the input string will always contain at least two words. The `penultimate` function in the example below does not return the expected result. Run the code below, check the current result, identify the problem, explain what the problem is, and provide a working solution.

### Implementation
  - The problem can be rectified by taking the length of the array minus `2`
