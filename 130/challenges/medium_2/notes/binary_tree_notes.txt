Understanding
  - Searching with non-consecutive numbers not efficient with an array if
    we intend to add values
  - If a value is added to an array that would otherwise be between indexes
    0 and -1, the entire array would have to be sorted
  - Keeping track of gaps between numbers would allow us to insert a new
    value
    + Still not ideal
    + The LS explanation mentions having to shift values, but I would think
      removing the placeholder (`nil`) would not require shifting...
  - Binarey Search Tree
    + A subsequent value added is based on the top-down traversing of the
      tree
    + Value added v. value at traversal
    + Greater than or less than: BINARY
    +
