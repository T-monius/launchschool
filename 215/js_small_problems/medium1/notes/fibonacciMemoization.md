## JS Small Problems: Medium 1 - Fibonacci Numbers (Memoization)

### Understanding
- Memoization stores function calls that have already been made so as not to repeat them
  + Where do you store them!!??
    * We cannot direct the compiler...
  + Can use a lookup table
    * Can return immediately if there is a property for `n` in the lookup table

### Examples / Test Cases

### Implementation
- Data Structures

- Functional Abstractions

- Algorithm

### Task
