## Practice Problems: Strings - Problems 1 - 3

### Understanding
- I don't know if I'm only supposed to use ES5 abstractions
  + A template literal is the ES6 way of programattically building up stings
  + Also, I could put values in an array and `join` them
  + I could alternatively us basic concatenation with `+`
  + `String.prototype.concat` may be the most string-like way of doing this

### Problem 1
- Create a variable named `firstName` and set it equal to your first name. Set another variable named `lastName` to your last name. Join the two together, separated by a space, and store the result in a variable named `fullName`. Log the value of `fullName`.

### Problem 2
- Call `concat` on `firstName` using `lastName` as an argument. Log the return value.

### Problem 3
- Split the fullName variable into an array that contains the first and last names as separate strings. Log the value of the array.
