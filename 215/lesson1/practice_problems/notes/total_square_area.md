## Practice Problems: Total Square Area

### Understanding
- The same as the `totalArea` function
  * Just add a filter step

### Task
- Now, write a second Function named `totalSquareArea`. This Function should calculate the total area of a set of rectangles, just like totalArea. However, it should only include squares in its calculations: it should ignore rectangles that aren't square.

### Implementation
- Filter
- Map
- Reduce
