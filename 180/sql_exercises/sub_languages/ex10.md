## DML/DDL/DCL Part 10
Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

CREATE SEQUENCE part_number_sequence;

### Answer
DDL. This statement is creating some aspect of a database and not the data within.

### Discussion
CREATE SEQUENCE statements modify the characteristics and attributes of a database by adding a sequence object to the database structure. It does not actually manipulate any data, but instead manipulates the data definitions. As such, CREATE SEQUENCE statements are part of the DDL sublanguage.

It could also be argued that CREATE SEQUENCE is DML; the sequence object it creates is a bit of data that is used to keep track of a sequence of automatically generated values, so it can be thought of as being part of the data instead of a characteristic of the data. However, all CREATE statements (not just CREATE SEQUENCE) are generally thought of as DDL
