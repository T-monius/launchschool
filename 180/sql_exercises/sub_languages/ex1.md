## DML/DDL/DCL Part 1
SQL consists of 3 different sublanguages. For example, one of these sublanguages is called the Data Control Language (DCL) component of SQL. It is used to control access to a database; it is responsible for defining the rights and roles granted to individual users. Common SQL DCL statements include:

GRANT
REVOKE
Name and define the remaining 2 sublanguages, and give at least 2 examples of each.

### Answer
The other two sublanguages are Data Manipulation Language and Data Definition Language

Data Manipulations language has to do with working with or changing data that is already part of a database. Two examples are `SELECT` and `UPDATE`.

Data Definition Language has to do with creating the schema or the structure of a database itself. An example is `ALTER` or `CREATE`
