## Conditional Subqueries: EXISTS

### Understanding
- 

### Task
- Write a SELECT query that returns a list of names of everyone who has bid in the auction. While it is possible (and perhaps easier) to do this with a JOIN clause, we're going to do things differently: use a subquery with the EXISTS clause instead. Here is the expected output:

      name
-----------------
 Alison Walker
 James Quinn
 Taylor Williams
 Alexis Jones
 Gwen Miller
 Alan Parker
(6 rows)

### Implementation
