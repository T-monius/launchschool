## Scalar Subqueries

### Understanding
- A scalar subquery returns exactly one row with one column
  + One value
  + Used in a surrounding expression

### Task
- For this exercise, use a scalar subquery to determine the number of bids on each item. The entire query should return a table that has the name of each item along with the number of bids on an item.

Here is the expected output:

    name      | count
--------------+-------
Video Game    |     4
Outdoor Grill |     1
Painting      |     8
Tent          |     4
Vase          |     9
Television    |     0
(6 rows)
