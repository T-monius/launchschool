## Update Data
It seems there was a mistake when we were inserting data in the birds table. One of the rows has a species of 'Crow', but that bird is actually a Raven. Update the birds table so that a row with a species of 'Crow' now reads 'Raven'.

### Further Exploration
Oops. Jamie isn't an Owl - he's a Hawk. Correct his information.
