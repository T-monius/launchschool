## Create a Table
Now that we have an animals database, we can lay the groundwork needed to add some data to it.

Make a table called birds. It should have the following fields:

- id (a primary key)
- name (string with space for up to 25 characters)
- age (integer)
- species (string with space for up to 15 characters)
