## JS230 - Front-end Development with JavaScript > Making HTTP Requests > Exploring the Booking App

### Task
- You'll be using a booking app throughout the exercise group, "Making HTTP Requests." To help you explore the documentation, try answering the following questions by running the server, opening your browser, visiting `/doc`, and carefully reading the documentation available for each route in the app. The app has seed data, so you can freely test out the different routes. You should only need to visit one route to determine the answer; if you'll need to visit more than one route, then the answer is "There is no route that will provide this information."

1. How many staff are there?
2. How many students are there?
3. How many schedules exist?
4. How many schedules have bookings?
5. Do all staff have schedules?
6. Did all students book a schedule?

### Understanding
- Run the app and carefully read the docs for each route
- The app has seed data
- Only need to visit one route to determine an answer
- Needing to visit more than one root means, "There is no route that will provide this information."

### Answers
