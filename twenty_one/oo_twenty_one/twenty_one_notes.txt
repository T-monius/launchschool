Game
  - The game could call the participants hand setter method to update
    the players cards
  - Currently, I pass the player's hand to the dealer to mutate it
  - Total
    + Total can be an instance variable
    + If I made a hand an object like `deck`, then, the hand could
      query itself.
  - Turns
    + The player's turn requires querying the player for what they want
      to do after seeing their cards.
    + Presumably, a value can already be established since both players
      have their cards after the deal.
    + After completing the turn portion of the game method, my turns are
      doing three things
      = They query the player
      = Udpade the players values
      = Output the new card values
    + If I get back into creating logic that has the query method query
      the player, I can have the `action` instance variable set based on
      the result of the players' choice.
    + Then, the dealer simply reacts to the action chosen by the player.
    + The turn method could be the same for both players
      = Simply call the dealer to act on the players action.

Participant
  - Hit & Stay
    + When it comes to these two variables, I need to indicate to the
      dealer what my choice is.
    + Since only the dealer has access to the deck, the dealer must
      analyze the 'action' each player intends to take.
    + 'Action' will be an instance variable of each participant
  - Busted?
  - Total

Player

Dealer
  - It seems obvious that the dealer has the capacity to deal
  - He also presumably holds the deck
    + Deck may be a collaborator object of the dealer
    + The Dealer deals from the deck w/ `deal` being a dealer instance
      method
  - The dealer has a 'deal' instance method
    + The method is very simple and thus flexible enough to be used by
      several other dealer methods.
    + The game will ask the dealer to deal out 2 cards to begin the game
      which is it's own unique action.
    + The dealer will have separate methods for dealing to the other
      participants or himself.
      = To deal to himself, the dealer can query it's own action
        instance variable
      = To deal to the player, the game will give the dealer access to
        the dealer's action instance variable by having the 'deal to
        player' instance method take a parameter.
Deck
  - Seems natural for the deck to be a data structure holding 52 card
    objects
  - Suits constant
  - Card values constant
  - `initialize`
    + Set deck instance variable to call `initialize deck`

Card
  - The card is a data structure with a face and a value
