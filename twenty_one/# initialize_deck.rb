# initialize_deck.rb

# Understanding:
# Deck must have 4 of numbers 1-9, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces
# Suit does not matter

# Data Structure:
# Since the value or state of the card doesn't matter, array?
#   Pulling a random value from array easy w/ Array#sample
# Otherwise, hash with key == card, and value
