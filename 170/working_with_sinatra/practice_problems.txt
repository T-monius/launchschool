For each of the following filetypes, indicate whether that filetype is considered server-side or client-side and why.
1) Gemfile
  - A gemfile is a file that is associated with the Bundler
    software for managing project dependencies. Project dependencies are stored on the server where the Ruby version and source code for the project are also stored. The Gemfile itself is stored in the local file system of the server, and any code that is run based on the gemfile is run on the local server before sending back a response as a string over the HTTP connection to the client.
2) Ruby files (.rb)
  - The ruby files associated with a project are stored and
    run on the server side. The output of a ruby file like an application file for a framework like Sinatra is used to issue a response to the client.
3) Stylesheets (.css)
  - Although stored on the server with the source code for the
    application, the `.css` file is not executed until the Browser (client) gets a response. The the client evaluates the `.css` file to render the reponse in accord with the file in the stylesheets.
4) JavaScript Files (.js)
  - JavaScript is used by the client for rendering the
    response and is executed on the client side
5) View Templates (.erb)
  - These files are run on the server side in order to put
    together a response for the client. The view templates dictate the presentation of the response that will be
    evaluated by the client and then rendered according to the
    stylesheets and JS.
