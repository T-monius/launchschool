## Function Context, Scope, and Closures - `myFilter()`

### Task
- In this exercise we'll update the implementation of myFilter by adding the functionality of accepting an optional thisArg just like the original Array.prototype.filter.

- Here's our original implementation. We also show an example of how we want to call our modified function: the 3rd argument, filter, supplies the desired context (thisArg).

- Modify the original implementation such that the expected result is returned. Don't use the thisArg argument of Array.prototype.forEach.
