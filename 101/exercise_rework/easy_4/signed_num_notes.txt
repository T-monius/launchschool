# signed_num_notes.txt

Understanding:
  - Just like last exercise
  - Exception, having a sign
Approach:
  - Have a flag for negative numbers
    + Only drawback is 0
    + The Test sweet has three test cases with so much variance
    + If there were 2, a ternary or flag would be best
  - Instead, I'll determine the sign with three options at the
    beginning
  - Convert the absolute value of the digits
  - Prepend the sign and return
