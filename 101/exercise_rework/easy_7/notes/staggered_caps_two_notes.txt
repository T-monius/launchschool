# staggered_caps_two_notes.txt

Understanding:
  - Parlay the previously written method
    + It capitalized every odd index
  - Input
    + String
  - Task
    + Capitalize every other alpha character
  - Output
    + String
    + Every other alpha character is capitalized

Implementation
  - Since the last method accomplished its task by counting the index, it
    will be useless for this go around
  - I can toggle a flag
    + Starts on
  - Iterate a string
    + If the character is alpha
      > Capitalize if the flag is true
      > Toggle the flag
