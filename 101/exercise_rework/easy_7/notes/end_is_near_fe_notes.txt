Further Exploration
Our solution ignored a couple of edge cases because we explicitly stated that you didn't have to handle them: strings that contain just one word, and strings that contain no words.

Suppose we need a method that retrieves the middle word of a phrase/sentence. What edge cases need to be considered? How would you handle those edge cases without ignoring them? Write a method that returns the middle word of a phrase or sentence. It should handle all of the edge cases you thought of.

Understanding
  - Input
    + String
  - Taks
    + Determine the middle word
  - Output
    + Single word
    + Middle word

Edge Cases
  + Empty or single word strings allowed
  + Strings with an even word count

Implementation
  + Guard clauses
    + Empty input, return empty string
    + Single word input, return that word
  + Get the length of the string
  + Determine half the length with integer division
  + Return the index at half
