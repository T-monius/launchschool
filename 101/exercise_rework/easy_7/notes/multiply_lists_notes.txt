Understanding:
  - Input
    + Two arrays
    + Array elements, numbers (integers)
    + Both arrays are the same length
      > If not, multiply that element by 1?
  - Task
    + Multiply elements with the same index
    + Store as the value of a new array at the given index
  - Output
    + New array
    + Same length as the input arrays
    + Values are the product of the input arrays at the same index

Implementation
  - Zip inputs
  - Iterate new array and reduce with multiplication
