# longest_sentence_notes.txt

# Understanding:
# Input
#   - Text file
# Task
#   - Parse file by sentences
#   - Sorting a long document can cause lag if storing in a
#     data structure
#   - Less computation power to iterate over each element and
#     replace the return string than to sort.
#   - Determine longest sentence
#     + Sentence length determined by number of words
#     + Endmarks : '.', '!', and '?'
#     + Non-endmark and white-space char sequences are words
#     + Can either break the sentences and store an array to
#       iterate over
#       > Does `String#Split` take multiple arguments?
#     + Can iterate character by character adding only alpha-
#       nums and store the current assertion only if longer
#       than the previous.
# Output
#   - Print longest sentence to std out
#   - Output number of words in the longest sentence

# Approach:
#   - Read in file
#   - Split file into sentences array
#   - Select the sentence with the most words
#     + Return that sentence and the word count
