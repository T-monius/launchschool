# sum_of_sums_notes.txt

Understanding:
  - Input
    + A single array
  - Task
    + Identify subsets
    + Sum each subset
    + Add the sums together
  - Output
    + An integer
    + Sum of all the sums

Implementation
  - Find combinations or repeat combinations of the arrays
  - Alternatively iterate/recurr slicing a continually larger portion of the
    array to determine the current subset
    + Store an array of subsets added to at each iteration/recursion
    + Helper method if recursion
  - Map the subsets and sum them
  - Sum the result of summing the subsets
