Understanding
  - Input
    > Positive integer
  - Task
    > Print a triangle with `n` number of stars
    > Concerning myself with the perpendicular sides of the
      triangle will automatically produce the diagonal
    > Is there a minimum output?
      + Is '1' star a triangle?
    > Print from 1 star on the first row until n stars on the
      last
  - Output
    > Triangle with `n` number of stars

Implementation
  - Iteration
  - Either use `Integer#times` or `Integer#upto`
  - Iterate printing index number of stars
    > The stars must be prepended by a converse number of
      spaces in relation to index v. total (n)
    > Spaces will be n - index
  - Print spaces
  - Print stars
  - Move on to the next iteration
