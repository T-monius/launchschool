Understanding
  - Input
    + Two arrays
    + They are both ordered
  - Task
    + Combine the two input arrays
    + Only include unique elements in the new array
  - Output
    + New Array
    + Unique values from the two input arrays
    + Ordered

Implementation
  - Set union (|) does this
  - FE: do it without set union
    + If both of the arrays are the same size, I can iterate
      one array with a declarative methodand include the elements of the other according to the index of the first.
    + If the arrays are not the same size, a more remedial
      iteration would do, and include elements of either array
      as long as there are still elements.
