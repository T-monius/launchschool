Understanding
  - Input
    + Float
    + Betwen 0 and 360
    + The full degrees represented by the leading value
      > Consistent as a float or String in degree notation
      > DMS
    + The floating point value represents minutes and seconds
    + One degree has 60 minutes
    + Minute has 60 seconds
  - Task
    + Convert the floating point value to DMS
  - Output
    + String for degrees, minutes, seconds
      > degree, Â°
      > minute, '
      > second, "

Implementation
  - Parse the float for whole number and decimal values
    + Input divmod(1)
  - Take the whole number push it to return string with degree
  - multiply the decimal value by 60
    + Separate the whole number and the decimal value
    + Push the whole number to a return string with minute
  - Multiply the decimal value by 60
    + Push the whole number to the return string with second
