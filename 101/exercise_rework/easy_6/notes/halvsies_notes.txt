Understanding
  - Input
    + An array
  - Task
    + Find half of the first array
    + Divide the Array into two smaller arrays of half the
      length
  - Output
    + Nested array with two inner arrays
      > Inner arrays are half of the input array
      > An odd length input array results in the first inner
        array being longer.

Implementation
  - Find the length of the input array
  - Get half of the length
  - If the array length is odd, then the first new array starts
    from 0 to half
  - If the array length is even, then the first array is a
    slice from 0 to half minus 1
  - The second array is always a portion from negative 1 to
    negative half
  - The penultimate test is for 1 element
    + With my current solution, I can use a guard clause to
      handle a one element array
    + I can also operate on the input array destructively in
      handling the first array so that I simply put any
      remaining elements in the second array
