Understanding
  - Input
    + Integer
    + Represents the length of the target element in the
      Fibonacci series
    + The first two numbers in the Fibonacci series are 1
      > Subsequent numbers are the sum of the previous two
      > Can seed a Fibonacci number generator with [1,1] or
        somehow indicate that the first two index values are
        1.
  - Task
    + Find the index of the first number that has the same
      length as the integer input value
  - Output
    + Integer

Implementation
  - Generate the fibonacci series until the length of the
    number at iteration/recursion is equal to the input value
    > Recursion
      + Return index if length of the current integer is equal
        to the first input argument
    > Carry an index counter
    > Set previous two numbers
