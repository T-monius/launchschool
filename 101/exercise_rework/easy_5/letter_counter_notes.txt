Understanding
  -Input
    + String
    + Words, space separated
  - Task
    + Provide a count for word lengths represented in the
      sentence
  - Output
    + Hash
    + keys = integer
      > Represents a word of that many characters
    + value = integer
      > Represents the number of words in the string for the
        corresponding key
      > count

Approach
  - Instantiate a hash with zero as a default
  - Split the input
  - Iterating over the input array
    + Access the hash and provide the count of the word at
      iteration as the key
    + Increment the value
  - Return the hash
