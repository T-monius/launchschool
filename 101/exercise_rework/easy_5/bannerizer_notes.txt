Understanding
  - Method
  - Input 
    + String
  - Task
    + Determine string length
    + Determine surrounding characters for the box at a given
      position
  - Output
    + Print the input string to the stdout inside of a box
    + Box is two lines taller on either side than the  string
    + Box is two characters wide on each side than the string
    + First line is '+-' followed by string length '-'s then
      '-+'
    + Second line is the '| ' followed by string legth ' 's
      then ' |'
    + Third line is the same as the second line but has the
      string as contents instead of spaces

Implementation
  - Set a variable to the length of the string
  - Make a helper to return the outer limits of the box
    > '+-' plus '-' * length plus '-+'
  - Helper for inner contents
    > '| ' plus ' ' * length or string plu ' |'
