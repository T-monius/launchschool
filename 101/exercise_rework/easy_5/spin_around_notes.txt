Understanding
  - Input
    + String
  - Task
    + Reverse the individual words in the string
    + The current implementation operates on individual words
      by first transforming the string into an array
    + The array is then iterated over, and the individual
      string/word is reversed
    + Although the inner words are mutated, the original input
      string is unchanged
        > The call to `String#split` returns an array
        > When the array is operated on, the individual words
          inside of the array represent unique strings that
          were returned as part of the call to `String#split`
    + When `Array#join` is called after the array is iterated,
      a new `String` object is returned.
  - Output
    + New String with individual words reversed
