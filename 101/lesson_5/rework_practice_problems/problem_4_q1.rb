# problem_4_q1.rb

# Understanding:
# The challnge is to find the value 3 in the collection and permanently
# increase it's value to 4.
# In the given data structure, there is a nested array whose second element
# is an array.
# The second element of the inner array is integer 3.
# My understanding of the task is to modify the collection itself.
# Must operate on the outer array first to get to the inner array where
# the integer value three is an element.
# Since transformation is to be performed, Array#map! is a valid option.
# I only want to implement a change if the element iterated on is an array.
# Can use Ã“bject#is_a? to determine if it's an array.
# If the element is not an array, the element should simply be returned.
# The if/else statement should return just the element 'el' in that case.

# iterated and operated on when I run the code in irb. I'm missing
