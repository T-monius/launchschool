# What is the default return value of to_s when invoked on an object?
# Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?

# Answer:
# The default return of `to_s` is that of `inspect` which is a description
# of the object id and a list of the associated instance variables as
# described in the Ruby docs for Object#to_s.
