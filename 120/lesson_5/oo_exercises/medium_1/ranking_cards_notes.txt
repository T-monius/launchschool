# For this exercise, numeric cards are low cards, ordered from 2
# through 10. Jacks are higher than 10s, Queens are higher than Jacks,
# Kings are higher than Queens, and Aces are higher than Kings. The
# suit plays no part in the relative ranking of cards.

# If you have two or more cards of the same rank in your list, your min
# and max methods should return one of the matching cards; it doesn't
# matter which one.

# Besides any methods needed to determine the lowest and highest cards,
# create a #to_s method that returns a String representation of the
# card, e.g., "Jack of Diamonds", "4 of Clubs", etc.

# Understanding:
# The Card class must be able to compare itself in order to be ordered
# Can include comparable
#   - Only have to define <=> in that case
# Royals
#   - Give the royals an integer value from inception?
#   - Use value hash
