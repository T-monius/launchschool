First Criteria
  - Apparently, the code for creating a fixed array is potentially in
    last test for this block of code where nil is multiplied by five
    which is also the number supplied to the constructor as an argument.
  - Do I override the to_a in this class like I would for to_s in many
    other cases?
Second Criteria
  - Is this not an array?
    + My first instinct would be to rely on all of the regular array
      methods, but is the intent of this exercise to create custom methods for this class?
    + I can use the Array classes methods, but must implement FixedArray
      class's operators to do so.
