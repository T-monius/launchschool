Pet Class

Owner Class
  - The owner's name instance variable is a publicly accessible getter

Shelter Class
  - Owner a collaborator object?
  - Pet is a collaborator object?
  - Both of the object types are instantiated outside of the shelter
    class, so it would seem that the Shelter class only takes stock
    of the return value of either objects name instance method.
  - Has the ability(method adopt) to add a pet object to an Owner object
    + Is this an explicit behavior that the Shelter class has based on
      it's use of the Owner collaborator?
    + The overall intent of this exercise may be a display of the use
      of collaborator objects.
    + However, since the program code doesn't explicitly show the
      implementation of the adopt instance method, it's a bit difficult
      to determine it's intent.
    + The previous exercise was a display of the use of protected
      methods, so one could say that this method written without a
      collaborator object would simply show the use of public methods
      outside of a class.
